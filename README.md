# Web-Scraper-Project
Portfolio Project 


This is a basic Web Scraper Algorithm using Python.

The purpose of this project is to be able to collect whatever data needed from the site into a CSV file format and be able to constantly update as needed.

The site that was used to scrape the data is the following: http://books.toscrape.com/

Hope you enjoy :)
